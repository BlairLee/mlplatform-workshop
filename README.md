# mlplatform-workshop

This repo contains example code for a basic ML platform, including a model template that data scientists can clone to start a new project and model serving.

### Why?

As data science teams become more mature with models reaching actual production, the need for a proper infrastructure becomes crucial. Leading companies in the field with massive engineering teams like Uber, Netflix and Airbnb had created multiple solutions for their infrastructure and named the combination of them as “ML Platform”.

We hope this repo can help you get started with building your own ML platform ❤️


### Based on the following projects:
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - for model serving
* [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/) - for experiment tracking
* [DVC](https://dvc.org/) - for data versioning
* [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) - for the model template
* [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) - Infrastructure as Code
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - for CI/CD

When building your own ML platform, do not take these tools for granted! [Check out alternatives](mlops.toys) and find the best solutions for your problems.
